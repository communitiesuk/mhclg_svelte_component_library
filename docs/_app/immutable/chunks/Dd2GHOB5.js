They show how
      to combine components and content to help users complete specific tasks.</p> <!> <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What are patterns?</h2> <p class="govuk-body">Patterns are best practice design solutions for specific user-focused
      tasks and page types. They combine components, content design principles,
      and interaction design to solve common problems in government services.</p> <p class="govuk-body">Unlike components, which are individual interface elements, patterns show
      how to use multiple components together to create complete user journeys
      and workflows.</p> <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Examples of patterns include:</h3> <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"><li><strong>Form validation</strong> - How to validate user input and show error
        messages effectively</li> <li><strong>Data entry workflows</strong> - Step-by-step processes for collecting
        complex information</li> <li><strong>Dashboard layouts</strong> - Organising data visualisations and key
        metrics for different user needs</li> <li><strong>Search and filtering</strong> - Helping users find and refine large
        datasets</li> <li><strong>Progressive disclosure</strong> - Revealing information gradually
        to avoid overwhelming users</li> <li><strong>Data export and sharing</strong> - Allowing users to download or
        share data in various formats</li></ul> <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-8">Patterns for data-rich services</h2> <p class="govuk-body">The MHCLG Svelte Component Library will focus on patterns specifically
