# Review checklist - for feature branches

### 1. Merging and pull requests

- [ ] Are there merge conflicts with the `Main` branch? <br>
      (developers should check for conflicts before submitting a pull request by merging `Main` into their branch.)

- [ ] Does the pull request clearly detail new dependencies and features, and list any specific checks which they want the review to focus on?

### 2. Is the component self-contained?

- [ ] Does the component have a simple and specific function? <br>
      (if the component's function is broad, the developer should consider splitting it into smaller child components.)

- [ ] Does the component fulfil its function without reference to external code or other components? <br>

### 3. Is the component fully-functional and resuable?

- [ ] List the different use cases for the component. Can all of these use cases be realised by adjusting the components props? <br>
      (if a use cases requires adjusting props in an opaque way, that use case should be demonstrated as an example.)

### 4. Are the component props well constructed?

- [ ] Are component props sorted into intuitive categories in the demo UI?
- [ ] Have component props been given names which accurately and succintly describe what they do?

- [ ] Have component props been given reasonable default values where appropriate? <br>
      (generally, props should have default values unless they are derived from the data pipeline)
