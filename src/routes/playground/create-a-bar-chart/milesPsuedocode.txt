Work out Row.svelte -> RowChart.svelte connection - DONE

Put anything in Row.svelte and get it displaying on our playground page - DONE

Make a row in Row.svelte and render it on our playground page - DONE

Understand the code in RowChart.svelte - DONE

Make something appear inside the axis - DONE

Call another component and render it inside the axis - DONE

Work out why the Row component isn't rendering inside axes - DONE - it is something to do with having divs in the bar component instead of svgs

Place it in an appropriate place on the chart - DONE

temporarily color the rows so that I can see how they are being rendered during development - DONE

Figure out how to render multiple rows so that appear one after another -DONE

Define function to space evenly along the height of the chart - DONE
input: number of rows
calculation: row height = chart height / number of rows
output: row height

Use existing parameter numberOfBars instead of my new parameter numberOfRows - DONE

DONE - Define an xScale based on data, use it to plot a bar for each row.
option 1 - import a library like d3
    how does d3 work? range from 0 to maximum / range of space. translation from data value to pixel value
option 2 - write my own transformation


Create functionality that allows a developer to re-order rows from highest to smallest.

--- create buttons for user to select ascending or descending order
    --- create button component with the text as input variable
    --- when button is clicked, run a function that sorts dataArray
--- clicking the button triggers a re-rendering of the chart
    --- first data array is sorted by the rowWidth value
    --- then it's the existing process of looping through dataArray
