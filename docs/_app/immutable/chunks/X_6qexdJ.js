      community. We work together to create, test, and improve components and
      patterns that help teams build better digital services.</p> <!> <!> <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we're working on</h2> <p class="govuk-body">We're continuously developing new components and patterns based on real
      user needs across government. Our work is guided by research, user
      feedback, and the evolving requirements of digital government services.</p> <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Current priorities</h3> <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"><li><strong>Data visualisation components</strong> - Charts, graphs, and interactive
        data displays for government statistics and reporting</li> <li><strong>Geographic and mapping components</strong> - Tools for displaying
        location-based data and services</li> <li><strong>Advanced form patterns</strong> - Complex data entry workflows and
        validation patterns</li> <li><strong>Accessibility enhancements</strong> - Ensuring all components meet
        WCAG 2.2 AA standards and work with assistive technologies</li> <li><strong>Performance optimisation</strong> - Lightweight, fast-loading components
        for better user experience</li></ul>  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-8">How we work</h2> <p class="govuk-body">Our community operates on principles of openness, collaboration, and
      user-centred design. We believe in working in the open, sharing our
      processes, and learning from each other.</p> <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Our approach</h3> <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"><li><strong>User research first</strong> - All components and patterns are based
        on real user needs and tested with actual users</li> <li><strong>Accessibility by design</strong> - We build accessibility in from
        the start, not as an afterthought</li> <li><strong>Iterative development</strong> - We release early, gather feedback,
        and continuously improve</li> <li><strong>Cross-government collaboration</strong> - We work with teams across
        different departments and agencies</li> <li><strong>Open source</strong> - All our code is open source and available
        for anyone to use and contribute to</li></ul> <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-8">Get started</h2> <p class="govuk-body">Ready to get involved?
